# BackPacker Typescript - Readme

## Vision (Why am I building this?)

To learn React and Redux in Typescript.

## Goals (Personal)

- Create my first full stack Typescript application

## Todos

[ ] cannot save empty bag name

[ ] clear input and login fields on submit

[ ] confirm token is removed on logout and a fresh one made for login

## Reflections & Learnings

- I can now create full stack Typescript React applications that include Redux
- I've learned my original backpacker application had a lot of code dumped into a single file, so I've split bags and items this time through and added better routes
- It was nice to read my original backpacker readme saying that I'd like to Typescript it one day, that day is here!

## Next Action Steps
