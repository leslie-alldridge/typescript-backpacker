# Typescript-backpacker-remix (Currently in Development)

# Goal

Re-write my backpacker app using Typescript which will provide a more scalable solution with code that is easy to understand.

Deploy in a Docker container so that new releases can be deployed stress free.

Learn how to code Redux in Typescipt.

Compare my finished product with my old code, to see how much I've learned in the last few weeks.
